    <p>During the late 1960s, after graduating from UC Davis (BA, 1966; MA, 1967) and moving to New York, Stephen
      Kaltenbach established a reputation in the emerging international field of Conceptual art. But in 1970, just as
      he
      was achieving career
      success, Kaltenbach abruptly withdrew to California’s Central Valley, appearing to abandon Conceptual work in
      favor of the more traditional mediums of painting and sculpture. Coinciding with the 50th anniversary of his
      “dropout,” this
      exhibition considers Kaltenbach’s engagement with time as a principal theme across his remarkably diverse
      career,
      which encompasses bronze time capsules, advertisements placed anonymously in Artforum magazine in 1968-69, and
      the
      monumental
      photorealist painting Portrait of My Father (1972-79)</p>
